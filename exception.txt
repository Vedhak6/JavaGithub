1. Difference between exception and error.

    Exception                                                                

* Exception is both checked and unchecked type.
* Recovery can be done using try,catch and finally.
* Exceptions are mainly caused by the application itself.
* ex ; java.lang.StackOverflowError, java.lang.OutOfMemoryError

    Error

* Error is unchecked type.
* Recovery cannot be done.
* Errors are mainly caused by the environment in which an application is running.
* ex ; Checked Exceptions : SQLException, IOException
       Unchecked Exceptions : ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException, NullPointerException, ArithmeticException.

2. Difference between checked and unchecked exception.

    Checked

* Checked exceptions occur at compile time.
* The compiler checks a checked exception.
* Here, the JVM needs the exception to catch and handle.
* ex ; File Not Found Exception
       No Such Method Exception
       Class Not Found Exception

    Unchecked

* Unchecked exceptions occur at runtime.
* The compiler does not check these types of exceptions.
* Here, the JVM does not require the exception to catch and handle.
* ex ; Arithmetic Exception
       Null Pointer Exception
       Array Index Out of Bounds Exception
